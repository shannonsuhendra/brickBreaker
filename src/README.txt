===================
=: Core Concepts :=
===================

- List the four core concepts, the features they implement, and why each feature
  is an appropriate use of the concept. Incorporate the feedback you got after
  submitting your proposal.

  1. 2D Array
	-- There is 3 layers of bricks. Each layer of bricks is stored in a 2D 
	array of Brick (which extends gameObj) that takes in x coordinate, 
	y coordinate, velocity x, velocity y, width, height and a boolean 
	that is true if it shows on the screen and false if it doesnâ€™t show on the 
	screen. It is an appropriate use of concept as the bricks are positioned
	in rows and columns.

  2.File I/O
	-- I am using I/O to implement high scores so i will store scores and 
	associated full name in a txt file. The reader will read all the data 
	(name and scores) there is and store it to an arrayList so that I can 
	store the current data at a specific index in the arrayList according to 
	its score (so arrayList will be sorted in descending order of scores). 
	Then, I am getting the first 5 index of the arrayList to show the top 5 
	leader board. After that, the writer will write the arrayList into the 
	txt file.

  3. Inheritance/Subtyping for Dynamic Dispatch
	-- I will have a power class that takes in x coordinate, y coordinate, 
	speed, width of the power, boolean that is true if the power if going 
	down the screen and false otherwise, boolean that is true if power is 
	activated and false otherwise, and a timer to keep track how long the 
	power is activated, and a abstract method powerImplementation. These powers 
	have different advantages. I will have 3 types of power: make paddle longer, 
	freeze the bricks (so the bricks will be moving down the screen slowly 
	initially), and create multiple balls. So I will have a powerPaddle, 
	powerFreeze, and powerBall class that extends power class and have different 
	implementations of the powerImplementation method that implements what the 
	power does. It is an appropriate use of concept as the powerFreeze, powerPaddle, 
	and powerBall takes in the same argument but has different ways of implementing 
	the powerImplementation. 
	
	changes: I have a gameObj class that takes in x coordinate, y coordinate, 
	velocity x, velocity y, width, height. Power class will extend gameObj and 
	takes in extra argument powerDown, powerOn, timer, and a abstract method 
	powerImplementation.
	
  4. Collections
	-- I am using arrayList to store multiple balls when the power ball is activated. 
	It is an appropriate use of concept as using arrayList allows me to easily add 
	multiple balls when power ball is on and remove the ball if the ball goes out of 
	the screen. At the start of the game, the arrayList will only have 1 ball so 
	arrayList size is 1. If user gets the power ball, it adds 4 different ball to the 
	arrayList.

=========================
=: Your Implementation :=
=========================

- Provide an overview of each of the classes in your code, and what their
  function is in the overall game.
  
  - GameObj: takes in x coordinate, y coordinate, velocity x, velocity y,
		   width, height and contains abstract method move and method intersects to
		   that returns a boolean if 2 objects collide.
	//Classes that extends GameObj
	- Ball: doesn't take extra argument. 
			** bounces off bricks, paddle, left and right screen
	- Brick: takes in extra argument boolean showBrick
		     that is true if it shows on the screen and false if it doesn't.
		     ** if brick is hit by ball, brick disappears from screen and score 
		     increases
	- Paddle: takes in extra argument boolean padLeft 
		      that is true if left arrow key is pressed and false otherwise, 
		      boolean padRight that is true if right arrow key is pressed and 
		      false otherwise. 
		      **For the ball to not go below the screen and for catching powers
	- EndLine: doesn't take extra argument. 
			  **To show player loses if the brick passes the y position of the line
  	- Power: takes in extra argument down, powerOn, time (explained further in 
  			 Inheritance/Subtyping Dynamic Dispatch implementation). It also contains 
  			 an abstract method powerImplementation, method showPowerName that shows 
  			 the name of power activated for few seconds on the screen, method draw 
  			 that draws a circle representing the power and method powerMove to have 
  			 the power go down the screen.
		//Classes that extends Power
		- PowerFreeze: doesn't take in extra argument but has extra private 
			variables: brickUpdate that is set to 0 if power is activated and 3 if 
			power is not activated, and brick1Color, brick2Color, brick3Color that 
			sets the colors to shades of blue if power is activated and to shades of 
			yellow if power is not activated.
			**freezes the brick from going down the screen
		- PowerPaddle: takes in extra argument paddleLength that is set to 140 if 
			power is activated and 70 if power is not activated.
			**increases length of paddle
		- PowerBall: doesn't take in extra argument. if power activated, shows the 
			power name on screen. Handling of multiple ball is done in brick board
			**creates multiple ball
			
		
- Were there any significant stumbling blocks while you were implementing your
  game (related to your design, or otherwise)?
  - It was hard to keep track all the variables and methods that were in my game as
	a lot of changes has been made. Commenting on what certain parts of my code does
	helps with remembering what I did before. 
  - When I run into an error, it was hard to tell where the error is coming from. I 
    traced my error by having print statements on the variables.
  - I first implemented an intersection method at the brick board class and had to write
  	similar code multiple times to account for an object colliding with multiple object
  	but realized I could write it at gameObj class instead.
  - I didn't have power class extend gameObj initially and realized sometime after 
  	implementing my 2 power ups that I could just extend gameObj as it has the same 
  	parameters with few extra argument. So i had to rewrite a few things.
  
 

- Evaluate your design. Is there a good separation of functionality? How well is
  private state encapsulated? What would you refactor, if given the chance?
  - I believe having brick, paddle, ball, power extend GameObj is a good design as it takes
  in similar values and having intersection method in GameObj prevents user from accessing
  the details if an object intersects another object. The powerImplementation is also
  well encapsulated as what the power does is being handled in it's own class.

  have used while implementing your game.
